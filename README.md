# Trader_sentiment_analysis
I have built a Classification model using Natural Language Processing to classify the trader sentiments based on the movement of stock prices.
The dataset used contains unfiltered raw data containing 4101 rows and 27 columns
The fields includes entries of date, stock price movement and trader perception based on a certain stock.
The data is cleaned, text processed and sentiment analysis has been done for every stock.
For the testing part, an accuracy score of 85.7% has been achieved with Random Forest Classifier technique.
